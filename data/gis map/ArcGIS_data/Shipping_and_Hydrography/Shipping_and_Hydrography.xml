            <abstract>Arctic lines of communication. In the case of the Northern Sea Route, the route is based on the actual route used by Russian icebreakers and cargo ships. The Northwest Passage is based on the channels that would be able to support large cargo ships. The transpolar route is a hypothetical route that could be used either as a result of ice-free summers or the extensive use of icebreakers and ice-hardened ships.</abstract>
