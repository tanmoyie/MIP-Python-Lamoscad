### Multiobjective Optimization of Resource Allocation

## Situation
Strategic planning of oil spill in Arctic
## Task
1. Formulate the problem into a mathematical optimization (Maximize spill coverage (and maximize effectiveness and minimize response time) and minimize cost)
2. Design a solution algorithm
3.
## Action
1. Formulate and write the computer model 
2. Implemented in Gurobi Python API
## Result
1. 82% coverage of oil spill in Canadian Arctic
2.
