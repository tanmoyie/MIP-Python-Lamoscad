### STAR
1. Situation: Strategic planning of oil spill in Arctic
2. Task: Formulate the problem into a mathematical optimization (Maximize spill coverage (and maximize effectiveness and minimize response time) and minimize cost) and Design a solution algorithm
3. Action: Formulate and write the computer model  & Implemented in Gurobi Python API
4. Result: 82% coverage of oil spill in Canadian Arctic
